======= WHAT IS PCB-FPW =======

The pcb-fpw FootPrintWizard is what the name says it will be:
a footprint wizard (a.k.a. footprint generator).

pcb-fpw is not a footprint editor, therefor one can NOT load an existing
footprint file into pcb-fpw, make some changes and save it back to file, and
subsequent load the edited footprint file into pcb.

======= ISSUES WITH PCB-FPW =======

All issues, bug reports and feature requests can be reported in the Launchpad
bug tracker, to be found at:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/pcb-fpw/

Your reports and feedback are welcome and appreciated, it is a chance to 
improve pcb-fpw.

======= HOW DO I CREATE FOOTPRINTS WITH PCB-FPW =======

A User Manual with pictures can be found here:

Now follows a condensed version without the pictures.

Graphical User Interface (GUI).
-------------------------------

The main, interactive, modus of operating the software is probably with the
GUI application "pcb-gfpw".

Basically it comes down to the following:
        - Startup the application,
        - fill the needed entries with values,
        - check the footprint in the preview popup dialog window,
        - modify values if needed,
        - save the footprint file.

Subsequent actions to load the footprint file into pcb are described in the
pcb, xgsch2pcb or gsch2pcb documentation.

The layout of the program consists of five tabs with entry fields and a
dimensions drawing area (when and if implemented), and a button bar with
eigth buttons on the lower part of the window.

As you start entering the footprint type by selecting from a specified list,
the program will guess for the prefix of the footprint as the first couple of
characters of the footprint name.

The program will also try to guess which entries are needed for this footprint
type and "grey out" the entries and checkbuttons which it thinks are not needed.

The first tab with entries is named "Footprint" and can be used for the input
of general information about the footprint.

The second tab is named "Pins/Pads" and should be used for the input of
information about the number and pattern of pins and/or pads, the shape and
clearances.

The third tab is named "Thermal pad" and can be used for an optional thermal
pad if the footprint type allows for such an option.

The fourth tab is named "Silkscreen" and can be used for the input of an
optional silkscreen to be drawn, such as package outline, pin/pad #1 marker
and/or courtyard.

The fifth and last tab is named "Heel & Toe goals".
This tab is for the input of heel and toe parameters to allow for the creation
of PLCC, SO, QFN or QFP packages.

The eight buttons in the lower part will have the following functions:
        - "Refresh": to refresh all entries,
        - "Dimensions": to view a dimensions legenda in a popup dialog,
        - "Preview": to view the footprint in a popup preview dialog (when and if implemented).
        - "Clear": to empty all entry fields and reset all check boxes to the default setting,
        - "Close": to exit the application,
        - "Open": to choose and read an existing footprintwizard file,
        - "Footprint": to write the current values in the entries into a footprint file,
        - "Save": to write the current values in the entries into a footprintwizard file.


Command Line Interface (CLI).
-----------------------------

The "other" modus of non-interactive (batch) operation is from the Command Line
Interface.

This assumes for an existing footprintwizard file (or series of files when
batch processing).

Footprintwizard files are to have a .fpw suffix.

For more information type:

fpw -h

Have fun creating footprints with pcb-fpw  ;-)
