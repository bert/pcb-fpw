<h2>What is "pcb-fpw" ?</h2>
"pcb-fpw" is a FootPrintWizard for <b>"pcb"</b>.<br>
<br>
"fpw" (<b>F</b>oot<b>P</b>rint<b>W</b>izard) is a Command Line Interface program 
for the (automated) creation of footprint files used by the pcb layout editor for the 
placement of parts in a pcb layout.<br>
"pcb-gfpw" is a GTK GUI version for the interactive creation of footprint files 
used by the pcb layout application for the placement of parts in a pcb layout.
<p>
 
<h2>What is "pcb" ?</h2>
"pcb" is an interactive <b>P</b>rinted <b>C</b>ircuit <b>B</b>oard editor for the
X11 window system (see <a href="http://pcb.gpleda.org">
http://pcb.gpleda.org</a>).<br>
PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can provide
industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data (X-Y data)
output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process.<br>
PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter, topological router and trace optimizer which
can tremendously reduce layout time.
<hr>

<h2>Intended usage.</h2>
The "pcb-fpw" FootPrintWizard is what the name says it will be:
a footprint wizard (a.k.a. footprint generator).<br>
<br>
pcb-fpw is not a footprint editor, therefor one can NOT load an existing 
footprint file into pcb-gfpw, make some changes and save it back to file, and 
subsequent load the edited footprint file into pcb.<br>
<p>
In a nutshell, the usage of pcb-gfpw comes down to the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Startup the application,
<li>Fill the apropriate entries in:
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>"Footprint"</b> tab,
  <li>The <b>"Pins/pads"</b> tab,
  <li>The <b>"Silkscreen"</b> tab,
  <li>The <b>"Thermal pad"</b> tab,
  <li>The <b>"Heel & Toe goals"</b> tab,
  </ul>
<li>Check the footprint in the preview widget (when and if this is implemented)
by pressing the <b>"Preview"</b> button,
<li>Save the footprint file by pressing the <b>"Footprint"</b> button.
<li>Save the footprintwizard file (for future reuse or debugging) by pressing
the <b>"Save"</b> button.
</ul>
<hr>


<h2>Starting up the application.</h2>
During the  startup of the application an <b>"About pcb-gfpw"</b> dialog appears, 
shortly followed by the <b>"main window"</b>.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/about_dialog.png">
<p>
The <b>"About pcb-gfpw"</b> dialog contains the following buttons:<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>"Credits"</b> button: clicking this button raises a 
<a href="images/credits_dialog.png">credits popup dialog</a> in which a message 
about the names of the authors or translators are given (select the tab of your 
choice).<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"License"</b> button: clicking this button raises a 
<a href="images/license_dialog.png">license popup dialog</a> in which a message 
about the license is given under which pcb-gfpw is distributed.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Close"</b> button: clicking this button closes the "About pcb-gfpw"
dialog.
</ul>
<hr>


<h2>The "main window".</h2>
The main window of the program consists of five tabs with entry fields and a 
preview drawing area (when and if implemented), and a button bar with five 
buttons on the lower part of the window.<br>
The titlebar shows the name of a saved footprintwizard file or the text 
"Unsaved fpw file" if no file has been saved.<br>
An asterisk between brackets "[*]" is shown when the contents of any entry or 
the state of any checkbutton are changed and no saving has occurred.<br>
<hr>


<h2>The "Footprint" tab.</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/footprint_tab.png">
<p>
The first tab with entries is named <b>"Footprint"</b> and can be used for the 
input of general information about the footprint.<br>
<ul>
<li>At the entry named <b>"Type"</b> the footprint type is entered by 
selecting a footprint type from a predefined list.<br>
The program will use this as a prefix for the footprint name if no footprint 
name is entered yet, or an existing prefix is altered.<br>
The pcb-fpw program will try to guess which entries are needed for this
footprint type and "grey out" the entries and checkbuttons which it thinks are
not needed.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<ul>
<li>The footprint types follow a "well known and standard" footprint
naming convention.<br>
<li>Entering no footprint type, that is a blank entry, will leave pcb-gfpw
clueless on how to generate a footprint.<br.
</ul>
<br>
Disclaimers:<br>
<ul>
<li>Only the prefix part of the "well known and standard" <a href="footprint_naming_convention.html">footprint naming convention</a> 
is used.<br>
<li>The actual data for creating footprints relies on vendor specific 
datasheets (both method and content).<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<li>The entry named <b>"Name"</b> will contain the name that the actual 
footprint file will get when the footprint is saved to disk.<br>
Add characters here to complete the footprint name.<br>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>If the footprint name contains additional characters , changing the footprint 
type will not update the prefix from the <b>"Type"</b> entry.<br>
<li>If the footpint name has a question mark as prefix, the program will try to 
lookup values for the indicated footprint.<br>
<li>The footprint name should be entered without the ".fp" suffix.<br>
<li>This is a mandatory entry, leaving this entry empty or filled with a non 
valid footprint name will <u>NOT</u> result in a footprint file when the 
<b>"Save"</b> button is clicked.<br>
</ul>
<br>
<li>In the entry named <b>"Units"</b> the units for the footprint dimensions 
can be selected.<br>
Currently only "mil/100", "mil" and "mm" are supported.<br>
pcb-fpw will apply the chosen unit type for all dimensions entered in the 
following entries.<br>
Changing the units type will not change the following entries 
automagickly, that is: if you switch the units type halfway the entries, you 
will have to do the math yourself.<br>
Note: this is a mandatory field, leaving this entry empty or filled with a non 
valid unit type will <u>NOT</u> result in a footprint file when the 
<b>"Save"</b> button is clicked.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Refdes prefix"</b> entry can be used to add an optional reference 
designator prefix to the footprint.<br>
Note: the prefix must be entered without the question mark "?".<br>
Example: "R" for a resistor.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Value"</b> entry can be used to add an optional value to the 
footprint.<br>
Example: "100k" for the resistor mentioned above.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body length (X)"</b> entry is used for entering the length of the 
package in the X-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body width (Y)"</b> entry is used for entering the width of the 
package in the Y-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body heigth (Z)"</b> entry is used for entering the heigth of the 
package in the Z-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is <u>NOT</u> used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
This dimension entry is here for future use of the height attribute of a 
package.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Radial package"</b> checkbutton can be used to indicate whether the 
package has a circular outline as opposed to a rectangular outline.<br>
Note: the default value for a package outline is a rectagular package for any 
undefined package types entered in the <b>"Type"</b> entry and this checkbutton 
not to be checked.<br>
In all cases defined package types entered in the <b>"Type"</b> entry, pcb-fpw 
follows the design rules for this package type.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Add license to footprint"</b> checkbutton can be used to include
a license text in the header of the footprint file.<br>
For now this is a hard coded text resembling the 
<a href="footprint_licensing.html">exception for symbols</a> as with 
gschem or fonts in general.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Add attributes to footprint"</b> checkbutton can be used to include
all values in the entries, and the state of all check and toggle buttons as 
attributes in the footprint file.<br>
This is to allow for future reference, Design Rule Checking and whatever other 
future purpose you can think of.<br>
</ul>
<br>
Now follow some entries about the <b>"Author"</b> and licensing of the 
footprint file.<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>"Author"</b> entry can optionally contain your name and/or e-mail 
address.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Distribution license"</b> entry can be used to refer to the license 
under which the footprint is released.<br>
As pcb-fpw comes under the GPL this is a default value which can be changed as
required.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Use license"</b> entry can be used to specify the usage under which 
the footprint may be used.<br>
The default value is "unlimited" which can be changed, as required, to whatever 
restrictions you want to impose on the usage.<br>
Examples: "unlimited", "commercial", "non-commercial", "personal", ... <br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Status"</b> entry can be used to specify the status of 
the footprint.<br>
Predefined choices are: "Experimental", "Private (not published)", 
"Public (released)", "Stable (confirmed by peers)", ... and whatever other 
status you can think of.<br>
<br>
</ul>

<h2>The "Pins/Pads" tab.</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/pins_pads_tab.png">
<p>
The second tab is named <b>"Pins/Pads"</b> and should be used for the input of  
information about the number and pattern of pins and/or pads, the shape and 
clearances.<br>
The first group of entries is for defining a <b>"Pattern"</b> of pins and/or 
pads.<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>"Total Pins and Pads"</b> entry is used for displaying the total 
amount of pins and pads entered in other entries.<br>
It is "greyed out" most of the time, and could have been a label widget as 
well.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Columns"</b> entry is used for entering the number of columns of 
pins/pads in a footprint.<br>
Example: the number of columns in a "PLCC" package is 2.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Rows"</b> entry is used for entering the number of rows of 
pins/pads in a footprint.<br>
Example: the number of rows in a "PLCC" package is 2.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pitch X-direction"</b> entry is used for entering the pitch of the 
pins/pads in the X-direction.<br>
Example: the pitch in the X-direction (as in a row) for a "PLCC" package is 
1.27 mm or 50 mil.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pitch Y-direction"</b> entry is used for entering the pitch of the 
pins/pads in the Y-direction.<br>
Example: the pitch in the Y-direction (as in a column) for a "PGA" package is 
2.54 mm or 100 mil.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Count X-direction"</b> entry is used for entering the number of  
pins/pads on a row (the X-direction).<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Count Y-direction"</b> entry is used for entering the number of 
pins/pads on a column (the Y-direction).<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pin/pads #1 position"</b> entry is used for entering the location 
of the #1 pin and/or pad of the package.<br>
It contains pre-defined <a href="pin_pad_1 locations.html">locations</a>.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pin/pads exceptions"</b> entry is used for entering the pins or 
pads that are not present at the package.<br>
All exceptions are to be specified individually by a row indicator where the 
indicator is one or more letters of the alphabet ([A .. Y, AA .. YY] etc. 
excluding "I", "O", "Q", "S" and "Z"), and a column indicator where the 
indicator is a member of the positive Natural numbers (N), each exception is 
separated by a comma (",").<br>
No wildcards ["?","*"] or collections [A1-A5","B2-B6"] allowed, this is left for
a future enhancement, and kudos if you send in a patch with a (fully tested)
solution ;-)<br>
Currently the limit is set to a maximum of 10.000 leads, and 80 rows
(this limit is hard coded for now).<br>
<br>
For entering large amounts of exceptions on BGA or PGA footprints, there is a 
select exception dialog available.<br>
This select exception dialog is invoked by clicking the button left of the 
text entry.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/select_exception_dialog.png"><br>
<br>
The above example shows that only the outer two rows/columns of leads of a 100 
pad (10 rows by 10 columns) BGA package (or all pins for a PGA package) are 
present.<br>
The 36 exceptions are withdrawn from the total number of pins/pads, and this is 
reflected in the "total pins and pads" entry after the "refresh" button is 
clicked.<br>
<br>
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>"Close"</B> button will ignore all changes and close the 
  dialog.<br>
  <br>
  <li>The <b>"Clear"</B> button will clear all ticks from check boxes in the 
  dialog (this means: no leads present on this package).<br>
  <br>
  <li>The <b>"OK"</B> button will accept all changes and close the dialog.<br>
  </ul>
<br> 
</ul>
<p>
The second group of entries <b>"Pins"</b> is used for the dimensions of 
pins (only).<br>
<ul>

diameter of the annulus of the pin.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pin drill diameter (d)"</b> entry is used for entering the inner 
diameter of the annulus of the pin.<br>
This is also known as the drill diameter.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pin #1 square"</b> check button is used for selecting a round or a 
square #1 pin.<br>
<br> 
</ul>
<p>
The last group of entries <b>"Pads"</b> is used for the dimensions of 
pads (only).<br>

pad.<br>
It contains pre-defined pad shapes.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pad length (X)"</b> entry is used for entering the length of the 
pad (in the X-direction).<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pad width (Y)"</b> entry is used for entering the width of the pad
(in the Y-direction).<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pad clearance"</b> entry is used for entering the clearance between 
the pad and other (conductive) copper traces or (polygon) surfaces.<br>
<br> 
<li>The <b>"Pad solder mask clearance"</b> entry is used for entering the
