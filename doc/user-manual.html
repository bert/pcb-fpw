<h1>pcb-gfpw User Manual.</h1>
<p>
<h2>Intended usage:</h2>
The pcb-fpw FootPrintWizard is what the name says it will be:
a footprint wizard (a.k.a. footprint generator).<br>
<br>
pcb-fpw is not a footprint editor, therefor one can NOT load an existing 
footprint file into pcb-fpw, make some changes and save it back to file, and 
subsequent load the edited footprint file into pcb.<br>
<p>
The usage of pcb-fpw comes down to the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Startup the application,
<li>Fill the needed entries,
<li>Check the preview widget (when and if this is implemented),
<li>Save the footprint file.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Starting up:</h2>
During the  startup of the application an "About ..." dialog appears, shortly 
followed by the main window.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-about.png">
<p>
The main window of the program consists of five tabs with entry fields and a 
preview drawing area (when and if implemented), and a button bar with five 
buttons on the lower part of the window.<br>
<p>
<h2>The footprint tab:</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-1.png">
<p>
The first tab with entries is named <b>"Footprint"</b> and can be used for the 
input of general information about the footprint.<br>
<ul>
<li>At the entry named <b>"Type"</b> the footprint type is entered by 
selecting a footprint type from a list, the program will guess for the prefix 
of the footprint as the first couple of characters of the footprint name.<br>
The pcb-fpw program will try to guess which entries are needed for this 
footprint type and "grey out" the entries and checkbuttons which it thinks are 
not needed.<br>
<br>
Note: the footprint types follow a "well known and standard" footprint 
naming convention.<br>
Disclaimer: only this part of the "well known and standard" naming convention 
is used.<br>
The actual data for creating footprints relies on vendor specific 
datasheets (both method and content).<br>
<br>
<li>The entry named <b>"Name"</b> will contain the name that the actual 
footprint file will get when the footprint is saved to disk.<br>
Add characters here to complete the footprint name.<br>
If the footprint name contains additional characters , changing the footprint 
type will not update the prefix from the <b>"Type"</b> entry.<br>
The footprint name should be entered without the ".fp" suffix.<br>
Note: this is a mandatory entry, leaving this entry empty or filled with a non 
valid footprint name will <u>NOT</u> result in a footprint file when the 
<b>"Save"</b> button is clicked.<br>
<br>
<li>In the entry named <b>"Units"</b> the units for the footprint dimensions 
can be selected.<br>
Currently only "mil/100", "mil" and "mm" are supported.<br>
pcb-fpw will apply the chosen unit type for all dimensions entered in the 
following entries.<br>
Changing the units type will not change the following entries 
automagickly, that is: if you switch the units type halfway the entries, you 
will have to do the math yourself.<br>
Note: this is a mandatory field, leaving this entry empty or filled with a non 
valid unit type will <u>NOT</u> result in a footprint file when the 
<b>"Save"</b> button is clicked.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Refdes prefix"</b> entry can be used to add an optional reference 
designator prefix to the footprint.<br>
Note: the prefix must be entered without the question mark "?".<br>
Example: "R" for a resistor.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Value"</b> entry can be used to add an optional value to the 
footprint.<br>
Example: "100k" for the resistor mentioned above.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body length (X)"</b> entry is used for entering the length of the 
package in the X-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body width (Y)"</b> entry is used for entering the width of the 
package in the Y-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Body heigth (Z)"</b> entry is used for entering the heigth of the 
package in the Z-direction.<br>
Note: this dimension is <u>NOT</u> used for the silkscreen artwork when this is 
checked on the fourth tab "Silkscreen".<br>
This dimension entry is here for future use of the height attribute of a 
package.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Radial package"</b> checkbutton can be used to indicate whether the 
package has a circular outline as opposed to a rectangular outline.<br>
Note: the default value for a package outline is a rectagular package for any 
undefined package types entered in the <b>"Type"</b> entry and this checkbutton 
not to be checked.<br>
In all cases defined package types entered in the <b>"Type"</b> entry, pcb-fpw 
follows the design rules for this package type.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Add attributes to footprint"</b> checkbutton can be used to include
all values in the entries, and the state of all check and toggle buttons as 
attributes in the footprint file.<br>
This is to allow for future reference, Design Rule Checking and whatever other 
future purpose you can think of.<br>
</ul>
<br>
Now follow some entries about the <b>"Author"</b> and licensing of the 
footprint file.<br>
<ul>
<li>The <b>"Author"</b> entry can optionally contain your name and/or e-mail 
address.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Distribution license"</b> entry can be used to refer to the license under 
which the footprint is released.<br>
As pcb-fpw comes under the GPL this is a default value which can be changed as
required.<br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Use license"</b> entry can be used to specify the usage under which the 
footprint may be used.<br>
The default value is "unlimited" which can be changed, as required, to whatever 
restrictions you want to impose on the usage.<br>
Examples: "commercial", "non-commercial", "personal", ... <br>
<br>
<li>The <b>"Status"</b> entry can be used to specify the status of the footprint.<br>
Predefined choices are: "Experimental", "Private (not published)", 
"Public (released)", "Confirmed by peers (stable)", ... 
and whatever other status you can think of.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-2.png">
<p>
The second tab is named "Pins/Pads" and should be used for the input of  
information about the number and pattern of pins and/or pads, the shape and 
clearances.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-3.png">
<p>
The third tab is named "Thermal pad" and can be used for an optional thermal 
pad if the footprint type allows for such an option.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-4.png">
<p>
The fourth tab is named "Silkscreen" and can be used for the input of an 
optional silkscreen to be drawn, such as package outline, pin/pad #1 marker 
and/or courtyard.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-5.png">
<p>
The fifth and last tab is named "Heel & Toe goals".
This tab is for the input of heel and toe parameters to allow for the creation
of PLCC, SO, QFN or QFP packages.<br>
<p>
The five buttons in the lower part will have the following functions:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>"Close"</b>: to exit the application.,<br>
<li><b>"Clear"</b>: to empty all entry fields and reset all checkbuttons to the 
default setting,<br>
<li><b>"Open"</b>: to choose and read an existing footprintwizard file,<br>
<li><b>"Save"</b>: to write the current values in the entries to a 
footprintwizard file and to generate a footprint file,<br>
<li><b>"Refresh"</b>: to refresh the preview area (when and if 
implemented).<br>
</ul>
