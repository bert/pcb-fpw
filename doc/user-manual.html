<h1>pcb-fpw User Manual.</h1>
During the  startup of the application an "About ..." dialog appears, shortly 
followed by the main window.<br>
The main window of the program consists of five tabs with entry fields and a 
preview drawing area (when and if implemented), and a button bar with five 
buttons on the lower part of the window.<br>
<p>

<p>
The first tab with entries is named "Footprint" and can be used for the input 
of general information about the footprint.<br>
At the entry named "Type" one can start entering the footprint type by 
selecting from a list, the program will guess for the prefix of the footprint 
as the first couple of characters of the footprint name.<br>
The pcb-fpw program will try to guess which entries are needed for this 
footprint type and "grey out" the entries and checkbuttons which it thinks are 
not needed.<br>
The entry named "Name" will contain the name the actual footprint file wil 
have.<br>
The footprint name should be entered without the ".fp" suffix.<br>
From the entry named "Units" the units for the footprint dimensions can be 
selected.<br>
Currently only "mil/100", "mil" and "mm" are supported.<br>
<p>

<p>
The second tab is named "Pins/Pads" and should be used for the input of  
information about the number and pattern of pins and/or pads, the shape and 
clearances.<br>
<p>

<p>
The third tab is named "Thermal pad" and can be used for an optional thermal 
pad if the footprint type allows for such an option.<br>
<p>

<p>
The fourth tab is named "Silkscreen" and can be used for the input of an 
optional silkscreen to be drawn, such as package outline, pin/pad #1 marker 
and/or courtyard.<br>
<p>
<img src="images/Screenshot-5.png">
<p>
The fifth and last tab is named "Heel & Toe goals".
This tab is for the input of heel and toe parameters to allow for the creation
of PLCC, SO, QFN or QFP packages.<br>
<p>
The five buttons in the lower part will have the following functions:<br>
<ul>
<li>"Close" to exit the application.,<br>
<li>"Clear" to empty all entry fields and reset all checkbuttons to the 
default setting,<br>
<li>        - "Open" to choose and read an existing footprintwizard file,<br>
<li>        - "Save" to write the current values in the entries to a 
footprintwizard file and to generate a footprint file,<br>
<li>        - "Refresh" to refresh the preview area (when and if implemented).<br>
</ul>
