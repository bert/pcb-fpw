      <title>What is "pcb-fpw" ?</title>

      <para>"pcb-fpw" is a FootPrintWizard for "pcb".</para>

      <para>"fpw" (<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>oot<emphasis
      role="bold">P</emphasis>rint<emphasis role="bold">W</emphasis>izard) is
      a Command Line Interface program for the (automated) creation of
      footprint files used by the pcb layout editor for the placement of parts
      in a pcb layout.</para>

      <para>"pcb-gfpw" is a GTK GUI version for the interactive creation of
      footprint files used by the pcb layout application for the placement of
      parts in a pcb layout.</para>

      <title>What is "pcb" ?</title>

      <para>"pcb" is an interactive <emphasis role="bold">P</emphasis>rinted
      <emphasis role="bold">C</emphasis>ircuit <emphasis
      role="bold">B</emphasis>oard editor for the X11 window system (see
      "<emphasis role="bold">http://pcb.gpleda.org</emphasis>".</para>

      <para>PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can
      provide industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data
      (X-Y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly
      process.</para>

      <para>PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter, topological
      router and trace optimizer which can tremendously reduce layout
      time.</para>

    <title>Intended usage.</title>

    <para>The "pcb-fpw" FootPrintWizard is what the name says it will be at
    most: a footprint wizard (a.k.a. footprint generator).</para>

    <para>pcb-fpw is not a footprint editor, therefor one can <emphasis
    role="bold">NOT</emphasis> load an existing footprint file into pcb-gfpw,
    make some changes and save it back to file, and subsequent load the edited
    footprint file into pcb.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Command Line Interface (fpw).</title>

      <para>The Command Line Interface program "fpw" can be used for the
      batch-wise generation of footprints.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Using the GTK User Interface (pcb-gfpw).</title>

      <para>For the interactive design and graphical oriented users there is a
      Graphical User Interface based on the Gimp ToolKit (GTK).</para>

      <para>There is a short tracked explanation of <emphasis
      role="bold">pcb-gfpw</emphasis> in the following section "In a
      nutshell".</para>

      <para>Users that need a more detailed manual can keep on reading in
      "Starting the application" and "Using the main window".</para>

      <section>
        <title>In a nutshell.</title>

        <para>In a nutshell, the usage of pcb-gfpw comes down to the

      <section>
        <title>Using the "main window".</title>

        <para>The main window of the program consists of five tabs with each
        several entry fields and a preview drawing area (when and if
        implemented), and a button bar with five buttons on the lower part of
        the window.</para>

        <para>The titlebar shows the name of a saved footprintwizard file or
        the text "Unsaved fpw file" if no file has been saved, in the top of
        the window.</para>

        <para>An asterisk between brackets "[*]" is shown when the contents of
        any entry or the state of any checkbutton are changed and no saving
        has occurred.</para>

        <para>The statusbar in the bottom of the window shows information,
        warnings and errors, if and when, for as long as they occur.</para>

        <section>
          <title>The "Author" tab.</title>

          <para>Now follow some entries about the "<emphasis

              <para>The default value is "unlimited" which can be changed, as
              required, to whatever restrictions you want to impose on the

          <para>The first tab with entries is named "<emphasis

                <para>The pcb-fpw program will try to guess which entries are

        <glossterm>aperture</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>In reference to RS-274X files, an aperture is a brush shape
          used to draw things. Originally, the aperture was a physical hole of
          a specific shape and size through which light exposed a photographic
          film.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>attribute</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Varied meanings. Elements and boards may have attributes
          assigned to them, which are arbitrary mappings between a name and
          its value. pcb does not currently use those attributes itself.
          Within pcb an attribute is an arbitrary value passed between the
          core and the various HIDs, such as checkboxes and file names.</para>

        <glossdef>
          <para>The most that the copper areas can be expanded before they are
          allowed to touch. For example, two 40 mil lines 10 mil apart can
          bloat up to (but not including) 5 mil before they touch, so the
          maximum bloat would be 4.99 mil.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>board</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>The physical printed circuit board that is depicted by your
          layout. "Board" refers to the physical board, "layout" refers to the
          electronic data.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>clad</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A thin layer of copper attached to a thin layer of insulator.
          Once etched, the remaining copper forms the electrical connections
          described by the layout file.</para>

        <glossterm>clearance</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>The distance beween the copper around a hole (the annulus) and
          the copper in the surrounding polygon, or between any other copper
          item (line or arc) and a surrounding polygon.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>courtyard</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>The area around an element which is still "used" by the
          element, for its electrical and mechanical clearance requirements.
          pcb does not use this term, nor explicitly support a courtyard
          definition for elements.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>drawing layer</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>While designing your circuit board, pcb provides a number of
          layers to draw on. While it's convenient to think of each drawing
          layer as corresponding to one of the physical layers (copper, silk,
          etc), it's possible to group multiple drawing layers together into
          one physical layer, or assign drawing layers to purposes not
          corresponding to physical layers. For example, you could have two
          drawing layers corresponding to your ground plane copper layer, one
          for the ground plane itself and a second (differently colored) one
          for any signals that need to be routed on the ground plane
          layer.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>DRC</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Design Rule Check. In pcb your design is scanned and compared
          to a number of design rules, such as minimum trace thickness and
          spacing, and any violations are noted. Then, you are tortured to
          death with non-modal dialogs.</para>

      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>drill file</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A computer-readable file intended to be used by automated
          drilling machines. The information includes drill diameters and
          locations. pcb may produce up to two drill files, one for plated
          holes and one for unplated holes. Automated drill machines were
          originally designed by the Excellon company, so drill files are
          sometimes called excellon files. Also called an NC drill
          file.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>element</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>In pcb an element represents any part you might install on
          your board, such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits.
          Note that this also includes anything on your board that has its own
          footprint, even if it doesn't have a part associated with it, such
          as test points, registration targets, and edge connectors. An
          element has a footprint, but is more than a footprint - it also has
          a reference designator (refdes), value, description, and location.
          "Footprint" refers to the pattern; "element" refers to the instance.
          For example, your layout might have four elements that use one
          footprint.</para>

      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>etch resist</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Not to be confused with solder resist, etch resist is used
          during the fabrication of the copper layers to define what copper is
          removed and what copper will remain.</para>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>fab drawing, fabrication drawing</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A drawing that shows a mechanical overview of the board,
          including the physical outline and all physical holes. This is often
          used by fabs to sanity check their interpretation of your design
          files.</para>

        <glossterm>fiducial</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A set of fiducials (typically 2, sometimes 3) can serve as a
          reference for a "Pick-and-Place" machine to accurately place parts
          on a pcb. Fiducials are free of solder mask and solder paste, as to
          provide a good contrast with the board materials to allow for proper
          optical recognition.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>footprint</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A footprint is the pattern on a circuit board to which your
          parts are attached. This includes all copper, silk, solder mask, and
          solder paste information. In other EDA programs, this may be
          referred to as a "land pattern". "Footprint" sometimes is used to
          refer to a footprint file. "Footprint" refers to the pattern;
          "element" refers to the instance in the pcb file. For example, your
          layout might have four elements that use one footprint.</para>
        </glossdef>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>footprint file</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A file that contains a single footprint definition. Normally,
          this means it describes one element, although there are
          exceptions.</para>

          <para>A region created by the designer solely to prevent something
          else from existing there. For example, an element with a copper
          keepout would prevent the autorouter from routing traces through

          Elements also have a mark; this is the local origin from which other
          locations within the element are measured. Element marks are drawn

        <glossdef>
          <para>For most drawing layers, the stuff you draw corresponds to
          stuff that exists in a physical layer. For example, trace drawn on a
          copper layer results in copper existing on the board. For negative
          layers, however, what you draw results in what does <emphasis
          role="bold">not</emphasis> exist on the board. The solder mask
          gerber, for example, is such a layer - a circle drawn in the solder
          mask gerber results in a hole in the physical solder mask. pcb
          represents such layers in a meaningful way on the screen, but
          exporters may use a negative layer according to the needs of the
          fabrication process.</para>

          the desired (loaded) netlist with the actual (copper) netlist and
          advise you of shorts or unrouted connections. If there are unrouted
          connections, it can use those to create a rat's nest to assist you

          that is used instead. While your board is itself a polygon shape, a
          polygon drawing object is not used to denote its outline - by
          convention, 10 mil (0.254 mm) wide lines are used to draw the

          <para>A file format used originally by photoplotters, but now used

          requires a separate file defining all the apertures, and is
          considered obsolete. The X variant is newer and includes the
          aperture definitions. Since these formats were defined by the Gerber
          Photoplotter company, they are commonly known as "gerber files".

          pads, this can help avoid shorts to those traces. Note that when
          shown in pcb the mask is drawn where the film exists, but when

        <glossterm>thermal, thermal relief</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Since copper is an efficient heat sink, connections to a large
          region of copper would be very difficult to solder - the copper heat
          sink prevents you from adequately heating the connection. To fix
          this, small cutouts are made around each such connection to create a
          thermal barrier, so that heat applied to the connection stays at the
          connection. Such a set of cutouts, and the copper bridges that
          remain, is called a "thermal". Thermals come in many patterns, which
          allows the designer to ensure adequate electrical connectivity
          and/or manufacturability.</para>
