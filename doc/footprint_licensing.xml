    <title>A word about Licensing.</title>

    <para>All software components of pcb-fpw are released under the GNU
    General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later.</para>

    <para>However, some confusion exists about the footprints.</para>

    <para>What license do they use? Will GPL footprints "infect" your design,
    thereby requiring you to release your design to the public ? If you modify
    the symbols, must you release the modified versions under the GPL ?</para>

    <para>The goal of the pcb-fpw Project is to provide an open-source EDA
    Suite which may be used for non-commerical as well as commercial projects.
    Our tools are aimed for use by students, hobbyists, educators,
    consultants, and -- yes -- corporate engineers. We are not interested in
    exerting any control over your designs, or forcing you to reveal
    proprietary information contained in your designs.</para>

    <para>Footprints are similar to the font files used in document processing
    software -- they are graphical objects used to express your ideas. We want
    you to retain control of your own ideas (your design), while the pcb-fpw
    Project retains a say in how you redistribute the footprints
    themselves.</para>

    <para>There are three ways a footprint might be distributed:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>As part of a footprint library, or individually as a .fp file
        (i.e. as a footprint itself).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Embedded in a .pcb file (i.e. part of the soft, or editable copy
        of a design).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The resulting graphical expression on a gerber file or printout
        of the pcb layout (i.e. as part of the hard, or non-editable copy of a
        design).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>There is a distinction between cases 1 and (2, 3).</para>

    <para>In case 1, the object of interest is the footprint library (or
    individual footprint) itself.</para>

    <para>In case (2, 3), the object of interest is the design.</para>

    <para>Some label case 1 "distribution", and case (2, 3) "use" of the
    footprint.</para>

    <para>Our goals for the footprints are:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We wish to distribute the footprints under a licencing scheme
          which encourages that you give back to the community if you
          redistribute the footprints themselves -- whether modified or
          unmodified.</para>

          <para>This is case 1 distribution. The GPL ensures this.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We wish to specifically prohibit anybody from building
          pcb-fpw's footprints into their *software* products, and then place
          restrictions on how the resulting product may be used. If you bundle
          footprints -- whether modified or unmodified -- into your software
          and then distribute it, then you must allow for the software's (and
          footprints') continued redistribution under the GPL.</para>

          <para>Again, this is case 1 distribution; the GPL ensures
          this.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>However, we do not wish to "infect" your *electronic* design,
          or force you to release your proprietary design information if you
          use or embedd footprints in your design.</para>

          <para>This is case (2, 3) use.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation has recognized a possible conflict of
    the base GPL with the use of fonts -- and, by analogy, footprints used in
    case (2, 3).</para>

    <para>Their solution is to use an exemption clause in the GPL which you
    explicitly insert for fonts.</para>

    <para>Read about it here:
    "http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException"</para>

    <para>Therefore, using this as a template, all footprints released with
    pcb-fpw are covered under the GPL with the following exception
    clause:</para>

    <para><quote>As a special exception, if you create a design which uses
    this footprint, and embed this footprint or unaltered portions of this
    footprint into the design, this footprint does not by itself cause the
    resulting design to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This
    exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the design
    itself might be covered by the GNU General Public License. If you modify
    this footprint, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    footprint, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.</quote></para>

    <para>The idea is that case 1 redistribution is covered under the GPL, but
    distribution of your design (case (2, 3)) is exempt from the GPL. This is
    the scheme which the pcb-fpw Project wishes to use for footprint
    distribution and use.</para>
