======= LIST OF ISSUES WITH PCB-FPW =======

pcb-gfpw (GUI):
-------------
- It seems that the "Total number of pins/pads" entry does not update correct
  when a predefined footprint is recognised and values are/should be loaded.

- The pin/pad exceptions dilog does not return the string with exceptions to 
  the main dialog entry.


fpw (CLI):
----------
- It seems that more error checking is needed to load a fpw file in a proper
  way.


Generated FootPrintWizard files:
--------------------------------
- Undefined string values are represented with (null).


Generated footprints:
---------------------
