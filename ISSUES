======= DEPENDENCIES =======

Building pcb-fpw from scratch, either from a tarball or from the git
repository, requires (at least):

gcc >= 4.1.1
autoconf >= 2.63
automake >= 1.9.6
glib >= 1.2.10
glib2 >= 2.10.3
gtk >= 2.8.20
libglade2 >= 2.5.1
cairo >= 1.0.4
pango >= 1.12.4
gettext >= 0.16.1

and any other dependency these packages may require.

YMMV with lesser version numbers, these are the minimum versions I use to
develop pcb-fpw with.
