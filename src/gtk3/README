======= WHAT IS PCB-GFPW =======

This is the GTK3 port of pcb-gfpw.

Building the GUI widgets and dialog is done with the GtkBuilder invoking
and processing a Glade UI definition file for every dialog needed.

After successful building the dialog a pointer of the TOPLEVEL widget is
returned to the caller.

Have fun creating footprints with pcb-gfpw  ;-)
