README for icon data

This file describes where the various icons came from and their license.

The FPW icon is designed by Bert Timmerman.
The mime registration data is to be done by Bert Timmerman (todo).

The icons are licensed under the GPL2 license.

Scalable versions: (128x128 canvas for the "hicolor" fallback theme).
These were scaled up from the 48x48 pixel targeted version.

application-x-fpw.svg (todo)

Pixel targeted variants:

application-x-fpw-{16,22,32,48}.svg (todo)

PNG versions of the above icons were created with GIMP.
The versions are copied and scaled from the 48x48 version:

regenerate the windows icon file. (todo)

This requires installed versions of:
